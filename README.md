# Fuse CPU: A Befunge Processor

The Fuse CPU is a processor that runs befunge code.

## Language Changes

A few changes have been made to Befunge for usage in the processor. The `~`, `&`, and `.` commands are not used. Instead, IO is implemented with memory mapping. `,` is only for debugging purposes. The hexadecimal diits (`a-F`) have been added along with the far get (`h`), far put (`q`), and interrupt (`i`) commands.

## Emulator

You cannot download the emulator yet because it is not done.
